<b>King William's War</b> was the First Intercolonial War fought in North America between the English Colonies and New France. It is also referred to as the First French and Indian War, as it involved the Iroquois Confederacy and the Wabanaki Confederacy.

<h4>Albany Plan</h4>

<h4>Proclamation of 1763</h4>
<p>The Royal Proclamation of 1763 was issued by King George III on 7 October 1763. It followed the Treaty of Paris, which formally ended the Seven Years' War and transferred French territory in North America to Great Britain.</p>
<h4>Treaty of Paris 1763</h4>
    <p>The Treaty of Paris, also known as the Treaty of 1763, was signed on 10 February 1763 by the kingdoms of Great Britain, France and Spain, with Portugal in agreement, following Great Britain and Prussia's victory over France and Spain during the Seven Years' War. Signed between Britain, France, and Spain, this treaty formally marked the end of the Seven Years War. The definitive Treaty of Peace and Friendship between his Britannick Majesty, the Most Christian King, and the King of Spain. Concluded at Paris the 10th day of February, 1763.</p>
<h4>land holding changes</h4>
    <p>The terms of the Treaty of Paris were harsh to losing France. All French territory on the mainland of North America was lost. The British received Quebec and the Ohio Valley. The port of New Orleans and the Louisiana Territory west of the Mississippi were ceded to Spain for their efforts as a British ally.
</p>
<h4>Native American Problems (post war)</h4>
    <p>The Native American tribes who had allied with the French often lost their French support and protection, leaving them vulnerable to British expansion. ith the French defeat, many Native Americans who had sided with France lost a valued trading partner as well as bargaining power over the British. Settlers' encroachment on their land, as well as the increased British military presence, changed the situation on the frontier dramatically.
