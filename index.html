<div><h3>Albany Plan</h3>
<p>The Albany Plan of Union was a rejected plan to create a unified government for the Thirteen Colonies at the Albany Congress on July 10, 1754 in Albany, New York. The plan was suggested by Benjamin Franklin, then a senior leader and a delegate from Pennsylvania.</p>

<div><h3>Proclamation of 1763</h3>
<p>The Royal Proclamation of 1763 was issued by King George III on 7 October 1763. It followed the Treaty of Paris, which formally ended the Seven Years' War and transferred French territory in North America to Great Britain.</p></div>
<div><h3>Treaty of Paris 1763</h3>
    <p>The Treaty of Paris, also known as the Treaty of 1763, was signed on 10 February 1763 by the kingdoms of Great Britain, France and Spain, with Portugal in agreement, following Great Britain and Prussia's victory over France and Spain during the Seven Years' War. Signed between Britain, France, and Spain, this treaty formally marked the end of the Seven Years War. The definitive Treaty of Peace and Friendship between his Britannick Majesty, the Most Christian King, and the King of Spain. Concluded at Paris the 10th day of February, 1763.</p></div>
<div><h3>land holding changes</h3>
    <p>The terms of the Treaty of Paris were harsh to losing France. All French territory on the mainland of North America was lost. The British received Quebec and the Ohio Valley. The port of New Orleans and the Louisiana Territory west of the Mississippi were ceded to Spain for their efforts as a British ally.
</p></div>
<div><h3>Native American Problems (post war)</h3>
    <p>The Native American tribes who had allied with the French often lost their French support and protection, leaving them vulnerable to British expansion. ith the French defeat, many Native Americans who had sided with France lost a valued trading partner as well as bargaining power over the British. Settlers' encroachment on their land, as well as the increased British military presence, changed the situation on the frontier dramatically.
</p></div></div>
<h2 id="car">Causes of the American Revolution</h2>
<h3>Mercantilism</h3>
    <p>During Great Britain's mercantilist period, colonies faced periods of inflation and excessive taxation, which caused great distress. Angry and frustrated American colonists revolted against the British, which led to the American Revolution and the end of mercantilism.
</p>
<h3>Parliamentary Legislation/Responses</h3>
<h4>Stamp Act</h4>
<p>an act of the British Parliament in 1765 that exacted revenue from the American colonies by imposing a stamp duty on newspapers and legal and commercial documents. Colonial opposition led to the act's repeal in 1766 and helped encourage the revolutionary movement against the Crown.
</p>
<h3>Intolerable Acts</h3>
    <p>Intolerable Acts, (1774), in U.S. colonial history, four punitive measures enacted by the British Parliament in retaliation for acts of colonial defiance</p>
<h3>forms of protest</h3>
    <p>Protests of the Stamp Act by colonists, as well as the refusal on the part of colonial government officials to collect taxes led to its repeal. The Townshend Duties were then introduced. This law required taxes on paper, paints, glass, tea, and any goods imported from Britain to the colonies.</p>
    <h3>committees of correspondence</h3>
    <p>Committees of correspondence were longstanding institutions that became a key communications system during the early years of the American Revolution (1772-1776). Towns, counties, and colonies from Nova Scotia to Georgia had their own committees of correspondence.
</p>
<h3>Continental Congresses (1st & 2nd)</h3>
<p>The Continental Congress was the governing body by which the American colonial governments coordinated their resistance to British rule during the first two years of the American Revolution. The Congress balanced the interests of the different colonies and also established itself as the official colonial liaison to Great Britain. As the war progressed, the Congress became the effective national government of the country, and, as such, conducted diplomacy on behalf of the new United States.
</p>
    <h3>Olive Branch Petition</h3>
    <p>The 1775 Olive Branch Petition was the colonists' last ditch effort to make peace with the British king and avoid a war between Britain and the colonies. But despite the effort to heal the broken relationship between colonists and the English crown, the King of England absolutely refused to even hear the petition.</p>
    <h3>Common Sense/Thomas Paine</h3>
    <p>Common Sense made a clear case for independence and directly attacked the political, economic, and ideological obstacles to achieving it. Paine relentlessly insisted that British rule was responsible for nearly every problem in colonial society and that the 1770s crisis could only be resolved by colonial independence.
</p>
    <h3>Treaty of Paris</h3>
    <p>The Treaty of Paris was signed by U.S. and British Representatives on September 3, 1783, ending the War of the American Revolution. Based on a1782 preliminary treaty, the agreement recognized U.S. independence and granted the U.S. significant western territory.
</p>
    <h3>Navigation Acts</h3>
    <p>In 1651, the British Parliament, in the first of what became known as the Navigation Acts, declared that only English ships would be allowed to bring goods into England, and that the North American colonies could only export its commodities, such as tobacco and sugar, to England. The Navigation Acts, while enriching Britain, caused resentment in the colonies and contributed to the American Revolution.
</p>
    <h4>salutary neglect</h4>
    <p>Increased colonial independence came to a halt when salutary neglect ended and the British government began reinforcing trade regulations and taxes on the colonists. The shift in control from Britain brought attention to the deep-seated resistance from the colonies, which ultimately led to the American Revolution.
</p>
    <h4>mercantilism</h4>
    <h5>change to policy post 1763
</h5>
    <p>The British pursued the Proclamation of 1763 to protect British settlers from American Indian rebellion. British also prohibited further settlements west of the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
    <h3>Parliamentary Legislation/Responses</h3>
    <h4>Stamp Act Congress</h4>
    <p>The Stamp Act Congress, also known as the Continental Congress of 1765, was a meeting held in New York City in the colonial Province of New York. It included representatives from some of the British colonies in North America. The Stamp Act Congress passed a "Declaration of Rights and Grievances," which claimed that American colonists were equal to all other British citizens, protested taxation without representation, and stated that, without colonial representation in Parliament, Parliament could not tax colonists.
</p>
    <h3>Boston Massacre</h3>
    <p>The Boston Massacre was a street fight that occurred on March 5, 1770, between a "patriot" mob, throwing snowballs, stones, and sticks, and a squad of British soldiers. Several colonists were killed and this led to a campaign by speech-writers to rouse the ire of the citizenry.
</p>
    <h3>Virginia Declaration of Rights</h3>
    <p>Virginia's Declaration of Rights was the first state declaration establishing the fundamental human liberties that the government was created to protect, and it had a profound impact on America's founding documents.</p>
    <h3>John Locke (enlightenment)</h3>
    <p>Locke based his Two Treatises around the idea of a social contract in which individuals consent to surrendering some of their rights in exchange for protection and order. American Revolutionaries adopted this notion and others, particularly in the Declaration of Independence.</p>
    <h3>Common Sense (Thomas Paine)</h3>
    <p>By promoting the idea of American exceptionalism and the need to form a new nation to realize its promise, Paine's pamphlet not only attracted public support for the Revolution but put the rebellion's leaders under pressure to declare independence.
</p>
    <h3>Declaration of Independence</h3>
    <p>The Declaration of Independence, formally titled The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, is the founding document of the United States. Its goals were to rally the troops, win foreign allies, and to announce the creation of a new country. The introductory sentence states the Declaration's main purpose, to explain the colonists' right to revolution.</p>
